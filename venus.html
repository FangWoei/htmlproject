                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s
                    closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner,
                    terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called
                    Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These
                    are not identical twins, however – there are radical
                    differences between the two worlds.

                    Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon
                    dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish
                    clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway
                    greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar
                    system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface
                    temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475
                    degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a
                    rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched
                    mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think
                    it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.
                    <br /><br />Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface –
                    more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure
                    you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.

                    Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its
                    axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the
                    solar system. This means that, on Venus, the Sun rises in
                    the west and sets in the east, opposite to what we
                    experience on Earth. (It’s not the only planet in our solar
                    system with such an oddball rotation – Uranus spins on its
                    side.) <br /><br />

                        Venus was the first planet to be explored by a
                        spacecraft – NASA’s Mariner 2 successfully flew by and
                        scanned the cloud-covered world on Dec. 14, 1962. Since
                        then, numerous spacecraft from the U.S. and other space
                        agencies have explored Venus, including NASA’s Magellan,
                        which mapped the planet's surface with radar. Soviet
                        spacecraft made the most successful landings on the
                        surface of Venus to date, but they didn’t survive long
                        due to the extreme heat and crushing pressure. An
                        American probe, one of NASA's Pioneer Venus Multiprobes,
                        survived for about an hour after impacting the surface
                        in 1978.

            <p>
              Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in
              size and structure, but Venus has extreme surface heat and a
              dense, toxic atmosphere. If the Sun were as tall as a typical
              front door, Earth and Venus would each be about the size of a
              nickel.

            <p>
              Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun, orbiting at a
              distance of about 67 million miles (108 million kilometers)

            <h4 class="pt-2">LONG DAYS, SHORT YEARS</h4>
            <p>
              Venus rotates very slowly on its axis – one day on Venus lasts 243
              Earth days. The planet orbits the Sun faster than Earth, however,
              so one year on Venus takes only about 225 Earth days, making a
              Venusian day longer than its year!

              Venus has a solid surface covered in dome-like volcanoes, rifts,
              and mountains, with expansive volcanic plains and vast, ridged
              plateaus.

            <h4 class="pt-2">YOUTHFUL SURFACE</h4>
            <p>
              The average surface of Venus is less than a billion years old, and
              possibly as young as 150 million years old – which is relatively
              young from a geological perspective. This is a major conundrum for
              scientists – they don’t know exactly what happened that made Venus
              completely resurface itself.

            <h4 class="pt-2">RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE</h4>
            <p>
              Venus’ thick atmosphere traps heat creating a runaway greenhouse
              effect – making it the hottest planet in our solar system with
              surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. The greenhouse
              effect makes Venus roughly 700°F (390°C) hotter than it would be
              without a greenhouse effect.

              Venus is permanently shrouded in thick, toxic clouds of sulfuric
              acid that start at an altitude of 28 to 43 miles (45 to 70
              kilometers). The clouds smell like rotten eggs!

              IVenus was the first planet explored by a spacecraft and was

              was also the first planet whose surface was reached by a
              spacecraft from Earth. The intense heat means landers have only
              survived for a couple of hours.t is unlikely that life as we know
              it could survive on Mercury due to solar radiation, and extreme
              temperatures.

              Venus is an unlikely place for life as we know it, but some
              scientists theorize microbes might exist high in the clouds where
              it’s cooler and the pressure is similar to Earth’s surface.
              Phosphine, a possible indicator of microbial life, has been
              observed in the clouds.

            <h2>Pop Culture</h2>
            <p>
              Because it’s so bright and easy to see in the sky, Venus has
              played a role in popular culture since ancient times, inspiring
              writing and song: <br /><br />
              It was called the most beautiful star in the sky by Homer, author
              of "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" – two of the oldest and most
              important works in Greek literature. <br /><br />
              More recently, Venus became a popular venue for 20th-century
              science fiction writers, including Edgar Rice Burroughs (“Pirates
              of Venus,” 1934); Arthur C. Clarke (“Before Eden,” 1961); and C.S.
              Lewis (“Perelandra,” 1943). <br /><br />
              Australian author Shirley Hazzard won the 1980 National Book
              Critics Circle Award for fiction with her book, “The Transit of
              Venus,” about two orphaned sisters. American author John Gray used
              the planet and its masculine counterpart to explain relationships
              in his 1992 book “Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.”
              <br /><br />A song called “Venus” was teen idol Frankie Avalon’s
              first No. 1 hit when it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in
              1959. A decade later, a different song called “Venus" by the Dutch
              rock band Shocking Blue topped the charts in several countries. In
              1986, British pop group Bananarama had a No. 1 hit in the U.S.
              with their cover of the song. <br /><br />
              More recently, Venus has been a backdrop for video games such as
              Transhuman Space, Battlezone, and Destiny. And in the Disney
              animated film “The Princess and the Frog,” Ray the firefly falls
              in love with Venus, “the evening star,” as he has mistaken it for
              another firefly.

            <h2>Kid-Friendly Venus</h2>
            <p>
              Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth’s closest
              planetary neighbor. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun,
              Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick
              atmosphere is full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it
              has clouds of sulfuric acid. The atmosphere traps heat, making it
              feel like a furnace on the surface. It’s so hot on Venus, the
              metal lead would melt. <br />
              <br />
              Venus is sometimes called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in
              size and structure, but the planets are very different in other
              ways. In addition to being extremely hot, Venus is unusual because
              it spins in the opposite direction of Earth and most other
              planets. It also has a very slow rotation making its day longer
              than its year.
